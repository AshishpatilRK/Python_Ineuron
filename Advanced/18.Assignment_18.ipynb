    "* For many types of data, binary representations are such more spance-efficient. For instance, you could represent an images as a text file. But any color represented as a 24-bit RGB value in a binary file has to be represented as a six-character code (e.g. FFFFFF for white) in text, which is literally twice as many bits. \n",
    "* Another reason for using binary formats is that they can map directly onto the internal representation of the data that the program is using.\n",
    "* If my program uses a complex data structure that's full of integer, float, and byte values, when I read it in from a text file i have to parse every character of text and interpret it, spending processing time (and writiong logic) to figure how to converrt the 88 bits in \"2983102931\", into the 32-bit integer that the text represents. If I read from a binary file, the program just copies those 32 bits from the file into memory.\n",
